# Workshop Spring Boot with MongoDB

This project was developed as part of my backend learning journey with Java.  
It focuses on building a RESTful web service using **Spring Boot** and integrating it with a **MongoDB** database.

The goal of this workshop was to understand how to connect Java applications to NoSQL databases and implement typical backend functionalities such as user and post management, data persistence, and CRUD operations â€” all using Spring's ecosystem and MongoDB's flexible document model.

This project was a practical step in learning how to build backend systems that work with non-relational databases.
